# SPORTS TOURNAMENT TRACKER

**_[Author: Thao Nguyen](https://github.com/xxnancyng/Dart_Projects/tree/main/sports_tracker)_**

This project is a sport tournament tracker built with Dart. It provides an easy-to-use application to organize and monitor local sports events. This tracker is designed to help players, coaches, and organizers manage local competitions more effectively.

## Features:

- **Player Profiles:** Store players' information including name, location, contact details, player ID, position, and their match history.
- **Team Management:** Allow coaches to manage teams, track match results, and monitor overall performance across tournaments.
- **Match Scheduling:** Help organizers schedule matches, record scores, opponent, date and update results (win/loss/draw) in real time.
- **Performance Insights:**
    - Calculate team wins, losses, and points.
    - Track individual player match history and statistics.

## Entities & Relationships:

1. Base Class â€“ ```Profile```
- Holds ```name```, ```location```, ```contact``` information (for players, teams, and tournament organizers).
    ```bash
    class Profile {
        String name;
        String location;
        String contact;
    }
    ```

2. ```Player``` (**extends** ```Profile```)
- Attributes: ```playerID```, ```position```, ```matchesPlayed```.
- Mixin: ```PlayerMixin``` to update performance statistics.
    ```bash
    class Player extends Profile {
        String playerID;
        String position;
        final List<Match> matchesPlayed;
    }
    ```

3. ```Team``` (**extends** ```Profile```)
- Attributes: ```teamID```, ```players```, ```matches```.
- Mixin: ```TeamMixin``` to calculate total points, wins, losses.
    ```bash
    class Team extends Profile {
        String teamID;
        final List<Player> _players;
        final List<Match> _matches;
    }
    ```

4. ```Match```
- Attributes: ```matchID```, ```opponent```, ```date```, ```goals```, ```result```
    ```bash
    class Match {
        String matchID;
        String opponent;
        DateTime date;
        int goals;
        bool result;
    }
    ```


5. ```Tournament```
- Attributes:```tournamentID```, ```name```, ```teams```, ```matches```, ```standings```
- Mixin: ```TournamentMixin``` to schedule matches and update standings.
    ```bash
    class Tournament {
        String tournamentID;
        String name;
        List<Team> teams = [];
        List<Match> matches = [];
        Map<Team, int> standings;
    }
    ```

class Profile {
  -String name
  -String location
  -String contact
}
class Player {
  -String playerID
  -String position
  -List<Match> matchesPlayed
}
Profile --|> Player

class Team {
  -String teamID
  -List<Player> _players
  -List<Match> _matches
}
Profile --|> Team

class Match {
  -String matchID
  -String opponent
  -DateTime date
  -int goals
  -bool result
}
Player "1" o-- "*" Match : matchesPlayed
Team "1" o-- "*" Match : _matches
Team "1" o-- "*" Player : _players
```


## Main Workflow:
1. Create players and teams
2. Schedule matches
3. Record match results
4. Update standings
5. View team & player stats
